                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Computer Organization and Architecture (CSC403) and Processor Architecture Lab (CSL403) are core subjects in the Second Year (Semester IV) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses establish the foundational understanding of how computers are designed, organized, and function at the hardware level, bridging the gap between software programming and hardware implementation.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in computer system architecture:

- **Computer Organization Fundamentals**: Register organization, instruction set architecture, addressing modes
- **Control Unit Design**: Hardwired control, micro-programmed control, control memory organization
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Binary arithmetic, Booth's multiplication algorithm, restoring division
- **Memory Organization**: Memory hierarchy, cache mapping techniques (direct, associative, set-associative)
- **Cache Memory**: Cache coherence, interleaving, memory partitioning, paging concepts
- **Input/Output Organization**: I/O interfaces, interrupt handling, DMA
- **Processor Design**: ALU design, adder circuits, shift registers, digital logic implementation
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Instruction pipelining, hazards, and optimization techniques

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, assignments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference**.

As I progress in my career, I recognize that computer architecture fundamentals remain essential for hardware design, embedded systems, and low-level programming. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental computer architecture concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through COA and PAL.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

> [!NOTE]
> **COVID-19 Impact**: This coursework was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Due to the nationwide lockdown and the sudden transition to online learning, several planned laboratory sessions and collaborative note-taking activities could not be carried out as originally intended. Despite these challenges, efforts were made to adapt and preserve as much work as possible. The limited chapter notes in this section reflect the disruption caused by the pandemic, rather than a lack of effort or commitment.
